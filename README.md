A mirror of the Android Screencast from Google Code.
The tool is used to cast the android screen on to a PC using Android Debug Bridge interface.
There are some limitations such as very low refresh rate, inability to use the PC's keyboard mouse etc., 
will be fixed in the future versions.
Mean while enjoy the accessibility.
Thanks.
